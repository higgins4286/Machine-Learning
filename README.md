This repository contains the code I wrote for four projects that I was assigned in my Machine Learning course.
We used the Breast Cancer Wisconsin (Diagnostic) dataset from the UCI Machine Learning Repository: 
    https://archive-beta.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/breast+cancer+wisconsin+diagnostic
Each of the four code files utilizes different machine learning methods, as follows:
  Project 1: FLDA Classifier 
  Project 2: Linear, Quadratic, DiagLinear, and DiagQuadratic Classifiers
