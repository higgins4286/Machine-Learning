<p>This repository contains the code I wrote for four projects that I was assigned in my Machine Learning course.<br>
We used the Breast Cancer Wisconsin (Diagnostic) dataset from the UCI Machine Learning Repository:<br> 
   https://archive-beta.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/breast+cancer+wisconsin+diagnostic<p>
   
<p>Each of the four code files utilizes different machine learning methods, as follows:<br>
  &emsp;Project 1: Fisher Linear Discriminant Analysis (FLDA) Classifier<br>
  &emsp;Project 2: Linear, Quadratic, DiagLinear, and DiagQuadratic Classifiers<br>
  &emsp;Project 3: Support Vector Machines (SVMs)<br>
  &emsp;Final Project: A combination of projects 1-3, with the addition of utilizing feature selection to pre-process the data before it enters the &emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&nbsp;pipeline.<p>
